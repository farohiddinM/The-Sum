                    BC Sports Hall of Fame: 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games
                    The BC Sports Hall of Fame educates and entertains through its programs and collections by telling stories of outstanding achievements in sport in British Columbia. TH= SUM, in partnership with Kei Space, worked together with the BC Sports Hall of Fame on their signature exhibit celebrating the 60th anniversary of the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games.
                    
                    TH= SUM was responsible for the creative direction and design of exhibit graphics and strived to retain the nostalgia of the times while giving it a modern feel. Colour and imagery were inspired by the original graphics created for the Games and media and artifacts combined within the exhibit brought the Games back to life for past athletes of the 1954 Games and visitors alike.
